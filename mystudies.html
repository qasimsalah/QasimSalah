        <h4>
            I started my studies in 2007 in the Sinjar district and completed my education in multiple Iraqi provinces and different districts.

            <h3>primary stage...</h3>
            <h4>
                I began my studies in 2007 at <mark>Jiyay Shingal</mark> School in the Sinjar district. However, in 2007 I was not old enough to officially enroll, so I attended the school with my father as an auditing student because he was a teacher there. In 2008, I was accepted as an official student at Jiyay Shingal School, and I started my formal education. I remained at that school for six years until I completed my elementary education. I was always an outstanding student during this period; in the first three years, I was consistently among the top three students, and although my grades were very good in the last three years, I was not among the top three. This is how I completed my elementary studies.

            <h3>intermeduate stage...</h3>
            <h4>
                I started my secondary education in Erbil Governorate after the events of 2014, where I joined <mark>Darbandi</mark> School in Kori Village, Erbil Governorate, in the 7th grade, where I successfully completed the year after all the difficulties we faced that year. After the death of my brother, we moved to Dohuk Governorate, and I started the 8th grade in <mark>Hafdam</mark> School in Domiz Dohuk. After I succeeded, I moved to <mark>Kani</mark> School in Qasara Village, Dohuk, and at that time I was in the 9th grade, and thanks to God, I was able to succeed in these three difficult stages, in which I faced many difficulties on the psychological level and many transfers.

            <h3>preparatory stage...</h3>
            <h4>
                I began my preparatory studies at <mark>Jia</mark> School, located in Malta, Duhok (for scientific studies). I studied there for three years, succeeded in the first two years, and then entered the 6th preparatory grade—an essential stage in any Iraqi student’s education that often determines their future. Unfortunately, perhaps due to our misfortune, after completing the first course, the coronavirus spread worldwide and schools were closed, marking a difficult period in our academic and social lives. Several times, dates for the ministerial exams were set and then postponed; eventually, a date was fixed, the exams were conducted, and thanks to God, I managed to pass with a score of 69.5.

            <h3>university...</h3>
            <h4>
                I enrolled at Duhok Technical University in the 2020-2021 academic year in the <mark>Information Technology (IT)</mark> department at Shakhan district. I studied for two years and graduated from that department, ranking 12th out of 40 students, and received my certificate from the IT department.
