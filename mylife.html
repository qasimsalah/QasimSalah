        <h1>my life</h1>

        <h2>introduction</h2>
        <h4>
            I am <mark>Qasim Salah Salih</mark> from Sinjar district, Mosul city, Ninawa Governorate, Iraq. I was born
            on 6 September 2002 in Sinjar, from the (Al-Babawaty) clan.<br><br> The reason for creating this website is
            to create my first website on the internet using programming languages ​​and to benefit from my knowledge
            and develop in this field.
        </h4>

        <h2>origin and education</h2>
        <h4>
            I grew up in Sinjar district where I spent the first 12 years of my life. The environment there at that time
            was socially calm. My childhood was beautiful, far from problems and conflicts. We used to meet with other
            children, play, go to school together,
            and spend a lot of our time playing football and other popular games at that time. Then the events of 2014
            happened and we were displaced from Sinjar due to the terrorist gangs’ attack on Sinjar and we were
            displaced to the city of Dohuk in the Kurdistan
            Region and after that we settled in Erbil Governorate, the capital of the Kurdistan Region and there I
            started my intermediate studies in the 7th grade, I used to go to school and I also used to work in a
            vegetable shop and after a few months it was the worst
            day of our lives when we received the news of the death of my older brother Muhannad Salah Saleh in Zakho
            District of Dohuk Governorate and after that tragedy we returned to Dohuk and settled there...<br><br>
            As for my studies, I started in 2007 but I was going to school
            as an auditor student and I was not an official student in the school and in 2008 I started as an official
            student in <mark>Jiyai Shingal</mark> School in Sinjar District and I finished my primary studies in that
            school and
            after we were displaced and went to Erbil I started
            my studies in <mark>Darbandi</mark> School I was in the 7th intermediate grade, and after we returned to
            Dohuk I
            studied in <mark>Hafdam</mark> School in the 8th intermediate grade in Domiz in Dohuk and then I moved to
            <mark>Kani</mark>
            School, 9th grade in Qasara village in Dohuk and after I succeeded
            in these stages and moved to the preparatory stage I moved to <mark>jia</mark> School in Malta in Dohuk and
            after I
            finished the preparatory stage I entered the university at Dohuk Technical University, Department of
            <mark>Information Technology (IT)</mark> in Shekhan district.

        <h2>personal experiences</h2>
        <h4>
            After 2014 we faced a lot of difficulties abroad especially after the death of my older brother I faced a
            lot of difficult experiences on the personal level and the academic level and through them I learned a lot
            of things and perhaps became more mature than I was before and I dealt with life's difficulties more
            seriously. Regarding work, my first job or place I worked in was in Salah al-Din resort in Erbil Governorate
            where I worked in a vegetable shop, after working in a restaurant in Dohuk and also working in a freight
            transport office as an accountant and that was after I graduated from the institute, then I worked in a
            tissue manufacturing factory and also worked in daily jobs, through which I gained experience and some
            experiments to deal with life's difficulties in a better way.
        </h4>

        <h2>values and principles</h2>
        <h4>
            In a world filled with challenges and changes, humanity and morals remain the greatest things a person can
            possess. True strength is not measured by positions or wealth but by the extent of one’s commitment to the
            principles that make them a true human being.Morals are not just social rules; they are the identity and
            essence of a person. An individual who lacks
            morals, no matter how much knowledge, money, or power they have, remains empty inside. Generosity, honesty,
            integrity, and humility are not just words; they are what distinguish a beloved person from one who is
            rejected by others. As Muslims, Allah has granted us the Holy Quran, the Sunnah, and the Prophet’s family as
            a complete way of
            life. Worship is not limited to prayer and fasting but extends to how we treat others. Islam teaches us that
            mercy, tolerance, honesty, and integrity are not just virtues but obligations for every Muslim. Allah says
            in the Holy Quran "قُولُوا لِلنَّاسِ حُسْنًا" (AlBaqarah83) a clear emphasis on the importance of good
            morals in our daily
            lives. In the end, morals and humanity are not just words but a way of life. If a person wants to leave a
            positive
            impact on this world, they must be a role model in their character and actions. True greatness does not lie
            in titles but in the hearts that we respect and influence.
        </h4>

        <h2>future aspirations</h2>
        <h4>In the future, I hope that the situation will be much better than it is now. On a personal level, if I have
            the opportunity to study in college, it will be a wonderful opportunity and I will develop in the field of
            programming. There are many opportunities in life. If I have the opportunity to work in some fields and
            develop in them, it will be wonderful. I wish success for me and all of you.</h4>
        <h2>conclusion</h2>
        <h4>In conclusion, I believe that life is full of opportunities that we must seize with determination and
            perseverance. Every experience we go through provides us with new lessons and helps us grow and develop. I
            will continue striving to achieve my goals, whether in the field of programming or other areas, with the
            belief that hard work and persistence are the keys to success. I wish myself and everyone around me success
            and prosperity in the future, and that we can turn our aspirations into tangible reality.</h4>
